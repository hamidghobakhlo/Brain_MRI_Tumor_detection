## Model Architecture

The neural network is designed with the following architecture:  

1. **Input Layer**: Processes MRI scans resized to 128x128 pixels as input.  
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts critical spatial features from the images using multiple filters with varying kernel sizes.  
3. **Pooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions while preserving essential features to mitigate overfitting risks.  
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Integrates extracted features for final decision-making.  
5. **Output Layer**: Performs binary classification, providing labels as "Tumor" or "No Tumor."  

The model structure is optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency, ensuring high performance on medical imaging tasks.
